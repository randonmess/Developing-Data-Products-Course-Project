# Developing-Data-Products-Course-Project
A Shiny app demonstrating the Central Limit Theorem. The app takes the number of observations of five fair dice rolls as a user imput. The server returns a histogram of the averages of five dice rolls. See the [github pages](https://randonmess.github.io/Developing-Data-Products-Course-Project/) for a five slide executive summary.
